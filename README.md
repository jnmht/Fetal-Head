# Fetal-Head

The aim of this project is to attempt to take in an ultrasound image of the womb and to segment the fetal head from the rest of the image. 

The detection of the fetus head is done manually by the clinicians and doctors. But, in 3rd world countries there may be a shortage of trained clinicians who can efficiently segment the fetus from the rest of the image and produce a report on the same.

The project aims to solve this problem for the clinicians and the patients so that the exact image of the fetus can be detected which makes it easier for the clinicians to produce an extensive image for the same.
We implemented both the unsupervised learning and the supervised learning methods to detect and segment out the fetus from the rest of the image.
